## Downloading binary data

The JMAP session object has a *downloadUrl* property, which is in [@!RFC6570] URI Template (level 1) format. The URL MUST contain a variable called `blobId`, MAY contain a variable called `accountId`, and SHOULD contain a variable called `name`.

The client may use this template in combination with an *accountId* (if required in the URL template) and *blobId* to download any binary data (files) referenced by other objects. Since a blob is not associated with a particular name, the template SHOULD allow a name to be substituted in as well; the server will return this as the filename if it sets a `Content-Disposition` header.

To download the data the client makes an authenticated GET request to the download URL with the appropriate variables substituted in. The client SHOULD send an `Accept` header with the content type they would like the server to return for the file. The `Content-Type` header of a successful response SHOULD be set to the type as requested in the `Accept` header by the client, or `application/octet-stream` if unknown and no `Accept` header given.
