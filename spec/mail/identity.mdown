# Identities

An **Identity** object stores information about an email address (or domain) the user may send from. It has the following properties:

- **id**: `Id` (immutable; server-set)
  The id of the identity.
- **name**: `String` (default: "")
  The "From" *name* the client SHOULD use when creating a new message from this identity.
- **email**: `String` (immutable)
  The "From" email address the client MUST use when creating a new message from this identity. If the mailbox part of the address (the section before the "@") is the single character `*` (e.g. `*@example.com`) then the client may use any valid address ending in that domain (e.g. `foo@example.com`).
- **replyTo**: `EmailAddress[]|null` (default: null)
  The Reply-To value the client SHOULD set when creating a new message from this identity.
- **bcc**: `EmailAddress[]|null` (default: null)
  The Bcc value the client SHOULD set when creating a new message from this identity.
- **textSignature**: `String` (default: "")
  Signature the client SHOULD insert into new plain-text messages that will be sent from this identity. Clients MAY ignore this and/or combine this with a client-specific signature preference.
- **htmlSignature**: `String` (default: "")
  Signature the client SHOULD insert into new HTML messages that will be sent from this identity. This text MUST be an HTML snippet to be inserted into the `<body></body>` section of the new email. Clients MAY ignore this and/or combine this with a client-specific signature preference.
- **mayDelete**: `Boolean` (server-set)
  Is the user allowed to delete this identity? Servers may wish to set this to `false` for the user's username or other default address. Attempts to destroy an identity with `mayDelete: false` will be rejected with a standard `forbidden` SetError.

See the "Addresses" header form description in the Email object for the definition of *EmailAddress*.

Multiple identities with the same email address MAY exist, to allow for different settings the user wants to pick between (for example with different names/signatures).

The following JMAP methods are supported:

## Identity/get

Standard "/get" method as described in [@!RFC8620] section 5.1. The *ids* argument may be `null` to fetch all at once.

## Identity/changes

Standard "/changes" method as described in [@!RFC8620] section 5.2.

## Identity/set

Standard "/set" method as described in [@!RFC8620] section 5.3. The following extra *SetError* types are defined:

For **create**:

- `forbiddenFrom`: The user is not allowed to send from the address given as
  the *email* property of the identity.
