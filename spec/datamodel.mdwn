## Data model overview

### Accounts

All data belongs to an account. An account may provide access to mail, contacts and/or calendars. Most operations are isolated to a single account; there are a few explicit operations to copy data between them. A single login may provide access to multiple accounts, for example if another user is sharing data with the user.

All ids are only unique within their account. Ids may clash across accounts.

### Mail

Each message must have a unique, immutable id. This id does not change if the message changes mailboxes. A mailbox is a named, arbitrary set of emails. For compatibility with IMAP, a message MUST always belong to at least one mailbox at any time.

Each message has 4 mutable boolean "flags" stored with it, each with a direct
equivalent in IMAP. In JMAP these flags are called:

* **isUnread**: Has the email not yet been read?
* **isFlagged**: Has the email been flagged (starred, or pinned)?
* **isDraft**: Is the email a draft?
* **isAnswered**: Has the email been answered (replied to)?

Messages are immutable other than these 4 flags and the set of mailboxes to which it belongs. To change anything else, the message must be deleted and a new one created (which will get a different id).

Related messages are grouped into threads. When getting a message list, you can collapse threads; that is the thread is only returned **once**, at the position of the first message in the thread in the non-collapsed list (given the sort order).

### Contacts

Each contact must have a unique, immutable id. A contact can be assigned to contact groups in a many-to-many relationship. A group is simply a named set of contacts. Contacts are completely mutable.

### Calendars

The calendars spec is coming soon.
