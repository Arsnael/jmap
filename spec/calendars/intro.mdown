# Introduction

JMAP is a generic protocol for synchronising data, such as mail, calendars or contacts, between a client and a server. It is optimised for mobile and web environments, and aims to provide a consistent interface to different data types.

This specification defines a data model for synchronising calendar data between a client and a server using JMAP.

## Notational Conventions

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [@!RFC2119].

The underlying format used for this specification is JSON. Consequently, the terms "object" and "array" as well as the four primitive types (strings, numbers, booleans, and null) are to be interpreted as described in Section 1 of [@!RFC7159]. Unless otherwise noted, all the property names and values are case sensitive.

Some examples in this document contain "partial" JSON documents used for illustrative purposes.  In these examples, three periods "..." are used to indicate a portion of the document that has been removed for compactness.

Type signatures are given for all JSON objects in this document. The following conventions are used:

* `Boolean|String` – The value is either a JSON `Boolean` value, or a JSON `String` value.
* `Foo` – Any name that is not a native JSON type means an object for which the properties (and their types) are defined elsewhere within this document.
* `Foo[]` – An array of objects of type `Foo`.
* `String[Foo]` – A JSON `Object` being used as a map (associative array), where all the values are of type `Foo`.

## The Date datatypes

Where `Date` is given as a type, it means a string in [@!RFC3339] *date-time* format. To ensure a normalised form, the *time-secfrac* MUST always  be omitted and any letters in the string (e.g. "T" and "Z") MUST be upper-case. For example, `"2014-10-30T14:12:00+08:00"`.

Where `UTCDate` is given as a type, it means a `Date` where the *time-offset* component MUST be `Z` (i.e. it must be in UTC time). For example, `"2014-10-30T06:12:00Z"`.

Where `LocalDate` is given as a type, it means a string in the same format as `Date`, but with the *time-offset* omitted from the end. The interpretation in absolute time depends upon the time zone for the event, which may not be a fixed offset (for example when daylight saving time occurs). For example, `"2014-10-30T14:12:00"`.

## Terminology

The same terminology is used in this document as in the core JMAP specification.

## Addition to the capabilities object

The capabilities object is returned as part of the standard JMAP Session object; see the JMAP spec. Servers supporting *this* specification MUST add a property called `{TODO: URI for this spec}` to the capabilities object. The value of this is an empty object.
