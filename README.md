# JSON Meta Application Protocol (JMAP) Specification

This repo contains the specifications for JMAP. JMAP is a protocol specification intended to be a new standard for email clients to connect to mail stores. It therefore intends to primarily replace IMAP + SMTP submission. It is also designed to be more generic such that it can be extended with contacts, calendars in the future (replacing CardDAV/CalDAV). It does not replace MTA-to-MTA SMTP transmission.

The pretty HTML version of the spec along with more JMAP info and resources can be found at http://jmap.io.
